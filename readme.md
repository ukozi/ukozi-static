# Ukozi Static Bot for Discord
Ukozi Static listens for attached files in Discord and scans them with the SentinelOne Static AI via the NEXUS SDK.

## Note: You will need to supply your own copy of SentinelOne's NEXUS. 

### About Nexus:
The Nexus Embedded AI software development kit (SDK), enables organizations to prevent malicious threats from entering non-endpoint attack surfaces. The SDK embeds SentinelOne’s Static AI engine to provide real-time threat prevention. The Static AI engine is consistently ranked in the top VT engines and third party tests for efficacy and lowest FPs.

The SDK’s portable technology can be leveraged to protect and scan all traffic in cloud services like email and web gateways, CASBs, file sync and share services, traditional file servers, USB scanning kiosks, medical devices, SCADA/ICS instances, containers and many more use cases.

## If you don't want to install...
